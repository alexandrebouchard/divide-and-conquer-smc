Bronx- 30.7% 
Brooklyn- 25.1% 
Manhattan- 20.0% 
Queens- 14.6% 
Staten Island- 10.0% 

Although it may seem that Manhattan is in the middle, it actually has the largest income disparity of all of the 5 boroughs. There are those 20% of the people living below the poverty line, yet there are the multimillionares in neighborhoods like the Upper East Side. That is true, to some extent, of all of the boroughs, with there being neighborhoods full of rich people and neighborhoods with poor people. 
People in NYC say that Staten Island is the most middle class borough, since only 10% of the households are below the poverty line, but the other 90% don't have ridiculously high incomes.

Good ones:

D25 http://insideschools.org/districts/queens/district-25?filter_borough=4&filter_district_neighborhood=district_25
District 25 stretches across a diverse group of communities in north central Queens, from Flushing's densely populated Chinatown to the more suburban neighborhoods of Whitestone and College Point. The district has many well-regarded, neighborhood schools, and most students attend their zoned elementary school.

D26 in northeast Queens has long been the city's highest achieving district. Its cozy neighborhood schools have veteran teachers, plenty of books and supplies and parents who put a premium on good education. 

Bad ones:

D23 One of the smallest in the city, District 23 serves Ocean Hill, Brownsville, and parts of East New York, and includes some of the city's poorest neighborhoods. Single-family homes are interspersed with old brownstones, apartment buildings, large public housing projects and homeless shelters.

Brownsville Many social problems associated with poverty from crime to drug addiction have plagued the area for decades. Despite the decline of crime compared to their peaks during the crack and heroin epidemics, violent crime continues to be a serious problem in the community.[14] Brownsville has significantly higher dropout rates and incidents of violence in its schools.[15]

D7 in the South Bronx includes a mix of desolate lots and industrial buildings, a vibrant shopping district, and wide streets with old brownstones, which have recently caught the eyes of Manhattan residents.
