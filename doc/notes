Bronx- 30.7% 
Brooklyn- 25.1% 
Manhattan- 20.0% 
Queens- 14.6% 
Staten Island- 10.0% 

Although it may seem that Manhattan is in the middle, it actually has the largest income disparity of all of the 5 boroughs. There are those 20% of the people living below the poverty line, yet there are the multimillionares in neighborhoods like the Upper East Side. That is true, to some extent, of all of the boroughs, with there being neighborhoods full of rich people and neighborhoods with poor people. 
People in NYC say that Staten Island is the most middle class borough, since only 10% of the households are below the poverty line, but the other 90% don't have ridiculously high incomes.
